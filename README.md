# SimpleScript

SimpleScript is an experimental, high-performance compiled programming language designed as a fast alternative to JavaScript. Built with Zig and powered by LLVM, SimpleScript compiles directly to native machine code with aggressive optimizations.

## ⚡ Why SimpleScript?

- 🚀 *Ultra-Fast* - 5x faster than Python, competes with C/Rust
- 🔧 *Native Compilation* - Direct to machine code via LLVM
- ⚙️ *Zero Runtime* - No interpreter, no VM, just native code
- 🎨 *Modern Design* - Built from scratch with performance in mind

## 📖 Language Syntax

### Variables

```
var x = 10 // Mutable variable
const PI = 3 // Immutable constant
```

### Expressions

```
var result = 10 + 20 * 3 // 70
var value = (10 + 20) / 2 // 15
```

*Operators:* `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

### Loops

```
for i in 0..10 {
  say(i)
}
```
